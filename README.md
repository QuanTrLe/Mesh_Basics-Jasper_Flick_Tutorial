# Mesh_Basics-Jasper_Flick_Tutorial
My process of following [Jasper Flick's tutorial on Mesh Basics](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/mesh-basics/).
The tutorial parts include:
- Procedural Grid: creating a grid using code to generate the vertices in their positions, then applying a mesh onto it in the editor
- Rounded Cube: generating vertices for a cube with rounded edges with different colors on each side for debugging
- Cube Sphere: mapping and generating a sphere from the previous part's cube vertex positions.
- Mesh Deformation: morphing a cube based on player left click input and have the vertices bounce back to their original position, simulating an elastic ball behaviour.
